Git Process for Homework, Projects, and Discussion
1. Open a terminal window or use the terminal in VSCode
2. Change directory to where you want to put the repo (cd dir or cd dir1/dir2/...)  
  • When you cd use quotes around directory names with spaces in them
3. git clone url # copy from your GitHub repo to your local computer  
  • If you want see what is in the repo be sure to cd to it
4. Edit your file in VSCode – get something working
5. git status # check what has changed (in red) and what is currently tracked for a commit
6. git add file # add the file to what is being tracked for a commit
7. git status # check what has changed and what is currently tracked for a commit (in
green)
8. git commit -m “message” # take a snapshot of your staged files – can undo back to this
9. git push # push from your local computer to your GitHub repo (use token for password if
asked for it)
Tips – be sure that you are in the directory for the repo when you do git status, git add, git
commit, or git push. They will only work in a repo directory.
